### Use Send and Archive to Reach Inbox Zero

If you aren’t familiar with archiving, it’s about time you learned. When you archive a message, you clear it from your inbox. It’s still available in the “All Mail” tab, but it’s hidden to reduce clutter. If you use your inbox as a to-do list, archiving a message is a great way to mark a task as completed.

Send and Archive makes this process even easier. Just enable it from the General Settings:

<img src="https://www.process.st/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screenshot-2016-05-02-15.47.30.png">

You’ll now have two “Send” buttons when you reply to emails. Send and Archive is the blue button and will be used by default when you use a keyboard shortcut to send an email. Once sent, the entire conversation is archived. All that empty white space in your inbox will make it easier to focus on the emails that matter.

### Auto Advance

If you use the archive function you normally return to your overview.
With auto-advance you can return to the next message.
Enable 'Auto-advance' in the labs section under settings.
